Time complexity
It is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run
-->as a function of length of the input
Why?
For making programs better

We cannot detech a algorithm by system speed it can be displayed by Time complexity

Big O Notation 
-->Contant time O(1)  
-->Linear time  O(n)
-->Logarithmic time O(log n) 
-->Quadratic time O(n^2)
-->Cubic time O(n^3)

f(n) --> 2n^2 + 3n = O(n^2)
f(n) --> 4n^4 + 3n^3 = O(n^4)
f(n) --> N^2 + LogN = O(N^2)
f(n) --> 12001
f(n) --> 3n^2 + 2n^2+ 5
